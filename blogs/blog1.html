      <h1>You are living in the matrix.</h1>

      <p class="blog-para">
        Recently, the trailer of one of my favorite movie franchises was
        released- <a href="https://youtu.be/9ix7TUGVYIo"> The Matrix Resurrections.</a>   For me personally it was a very
        nostalgic experience. You see, as a child, the matrix franchise was one
        of those Sci-Fi movies that completely blew my mind. It made a huge
        impact on the way I perceived the world, so much so, that both my first
        email id and password had the word ‘MATRIX’ in it. I was completely
        awestruck by its central premise: ‘you are living in a dream world,
        Neo’. I, for some reason always thought it to be true, and even today I
        think there is a bit of truth in it. Here are my reasons why this world
        is not real and you are dreaming right now:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> The experience of sleep:</strong> There are two kinds of
          sleep, first is the dreamless, peaceful deep sleep, and the second is
          the REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is the dream state. You may
          have experienced that while you are dreaming, everything seems real to
          you. Typically, it doesn’t occur to you that you are dreaming, and you
          just accept and confirm to whatever reality is being presented to you
          in the moment.
          
          <br>
          
          What guarantee do you have that you haven’t accepted
          reality the way it is right now? Also, maybe you are just confirming
          to the reality as it is right now, without asking the basic questions?
          You only realize you were dreaming only after you wake up. What if you
          are dreaming right now and you are going to wake up?
        </li>

        <br />
        <li>
          <strong> Maya:</strong>
          Sanskrit for “Illusion”. The scriptures of several religions have
          often talked about the human life. When it comes to the Sanathan
          Dharma (Hinduism), the scriptures mention the concept of Maya. Infact,
          according to the Hindu mythology, all human beings are merely living
          in the dreams of Brahma, the God responsible for the creation of the
          universe.
          <br>
          On a personal level, Maya is characterized by ‘Ajnana’,
          i.e., ignorance. Ignorance of the fact that we are all parts of the
          whole called Brahman- the Supreme Being. It is the dharma of every
          human being, to realize god, and realize the truth. Have you realized
          the truth yet? The fact that ancient religious scriptures deal with
          the concept of Maya strengthens the fact about this world being an
          illusion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="blog-para"   >
        So how do you convince yourself that you aren’t dreaming right now? Or to put it in a better way, “ <strong>Do you think that's air you're breathing now?</strong> ”.
